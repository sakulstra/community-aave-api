# Rates calculation

Calculating rates in Aave is somehwhat complicated due to the interest bearing nature of aTokens.

The reason for that is twofold:

1. liquidity of aTokens constantly changes which is making utilization based rates extremly dynamic (it's changing every second)
2. depositor interest is not only based on interest, but also includes factors like flash premiums (so it's usually "a little more")

Therefore the aave protocol keeps track of two values:

**Rate**: The rate is a purly utilization based metric which represents the current rate at this point of time.

**Index**: The index keeps track of "growth" also incorporating things like the flash premium.

To calculate correct historically archived deposit rates you should use [index based rate claculation](https://github.com/aave/aave-js/blob/v2/src/helpers/pool-math.ts#L124).

## Example Code

export const query1 = `
{
  # v1 query
  reserves(first: 1) {
    lastUpdateTimestamp
    liquidityIndex
    variableBorrowIndex
    paramsHistory(first: 1, orderDirection: asc){
      timestamp
    	liquidityIndex
    	variableBorrowIndex
    }
  }
}
`;

<MiniGraphiQL

  query={query1}
/>

```ts
import { calculateAverageRate } from "@aave/protocol-js";

const result = {
  lastUpdateTimestamp: 1611926412,
  liquidityIndex: "1031830159181667334741382194",
  variableBorrowIndex: "1048002659480593195934069307",
  paramsHistory: [
    {
      timestamp: 1606903009,
      liquidityIndex: "1021187617641523092754480830",
      variableBorrowIndex: "1034162815675781948442542345",
    },
  ],
};

const archivedRate = calculateAverageRate(
  result.paramsHistory[0].liquidityIndex,
  result.liquidityIndex,
  result.paramsHistory[0].timestamp,
  result.lastUpdateTimestamp
);
```
