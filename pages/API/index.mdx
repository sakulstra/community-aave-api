# Getting started

You should be able to just fetch any api endpoint exposed here:

```js
const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());
const incomeEndpoint = "/api/income";

fetcher(incomeEndpoint).then(console.log);
```

While there aren't a lot of endpoints exposed at this moment I expect their number to grow over time trough community contributions.

## Adding a new endpoint

...soon
