# Motivation

In the aave community a lot of people seem to struggle with the same things over & over again.
With this project I try to create:

1. a community sourced documentation for things they learned on their jurney
2. a community sourced api interface or commonly required features

## Official data apis

### V1

#### Graphql

Aave provides a public subgraph hosten on [thegraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/aave/protocol-multy-raw).

export const query1 = `
{
  pools {
    id
  }
}
`;

<MiniGraphiQL
  url="https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/aave/protocol-multy-raw"
  query={query1}
/>

### V2

#### Graphql

Aave provides a public subgraph hosten on [thegraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/aave/protocol-v2)

export const query2 = `
{
  pools {
    id
  }
}
`;

<MiniGraphiQL
  url="https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/aave/protocol-v2"
  query={query2}
/>
